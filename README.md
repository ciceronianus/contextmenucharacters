# What is this?
This little programme for Windows made in AutoHotkey has one simple purpose: to make an easily customizable context menu to insert unusual characters.

# Why was this program created?
I needed a simple way to insert various unusual characters from the middle ages, like ꝭ, ꝯ and ꝝ. The program is, however, flexible and can be configured to insert any other characters or even text snippets.

# How to install it? 
Download the .zip file, unpack it and configure the .ini file as you wish. 
Then start ContextMenuCharacters.exe.

No installation is needed.

# How to use it? 
There are two ways how to invoke the custom context menu:
1. By pressing the middle button of the mouse together with the CTRL key.
2. By typing .bb .

# How to modify the code?
Look at the .ahk file in the zip file.
